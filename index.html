  <h1>Thunder</h1>

  <p1>
    Just a young gun with a quick fuse
    I was uptight, wanna let loose
    I was dreaming of bigger things and
    Wanna leave my own life behind </p1><br>

  <p2>Not a "Yes, sir", not a follower
    Fit the box, fit the mold, have a seat
    In the foyer, take a number
    I was lightning before the thunder, (thunder)</p2><br>

  <p3> Thunder, thunder, thun-
    Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
    Thunder, thunder, thun-
    Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
    Thunder, feel the thunder (thunder, thunder, thun-)
    Lightning then the thunder (thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
    Thunder, feel the thunder (thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
    Lightning then the thunder, thunder (th-th-thunder)
    Thunder (thun-, thun-)Thunder</p3><br>

  <p4> Kids were laughing in my classes
    While I was scheming for the masses
    Who do you think you are?
    Dreaming 'bout being a big star </p4> <br>

  <p5> They say, "You're basic", they say, "You're easy"
    You're always riding in the backseat
    Now I'm smiling from the stage while
    You were clapping in the nosebleeds </p5> <br>
